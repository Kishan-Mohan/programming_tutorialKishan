/*  
 *  I made two folders in Unity called Character and Managers. 
 *  In the character folder I created a C# script called Player
 *  In the Managers folder I created a C# script called InputManager
 *  then we made a Input action called GameContents. 
 *  We set the actions to make the player use WASD and SPACE keys to make the cube jump
 *  I opened the InputManager script and coded the following
 *  The Init method is coded to connect the WASD and SPACE keys
 *  calling myPlayer in the brackets we use it to call of variables, in this case we called 
 *  the keys to move and jump
 *  The SetGameControls to Enable Ingame controls and Disable the UI
 *  The SetUIControls to Enable UI controls and Disable the Ingame
